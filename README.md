# Minesweeper Solver AI

## Overview

Welcome to the Minesweeper Solver AI project! This project is designed to showcase an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can solve Minesweeper games automatically. Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the player uncovers cells on a grid, trying to avoid mines.

This Minesweeper Solver AI uses logic to solve mine fields, however, this algorithm doesn't handle tha cases where the player has to flag a random tile.

## Features

- **Automatic Solving:** The AI is capable of automatically solving Minesweeper boards of various sizes and mine rates.
- **User Interface:** While the primary focus is on the solving algorithm, a simple user interface is provided to visualize the agent's results.
- **Customizable Parameters:** The parameters of the game, such as the size of the mine field and the mine rate (the percentage of mines on the board) can be adjusted

## Running the algorithm

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone git@github.com:MherGhev/Minesweeper-AI.git

2. Open the html file:

    Open the index.html file. 

3. (Optional) Analyze:

    Uncomment the analyze() function call in the analytics.js file and open the console in the browser. <b>Be aware that your PC might lag.</b>
